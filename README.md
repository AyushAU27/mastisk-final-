# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-MRI-Images-Detection
Mastisk is a deep learning-based system designed to detect and classify brain 
tumors from medical imaging data, such as MRI scans. Brain tumors pose a 
significant health risk, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. 
Traditional methods rely on manual interpretation by radiologists, which can be 

 time-consuming and prone to human error. 
Mastisk leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and machine 
learning/deep learning techniques to automate the detection and classification 
process, improving accuracy and efficiency. The system is capable of 
distinguishing between different types of brain tumors, such as gliomas, 
meningiomas, and pituitary tumors, aiding healthcare professionals in making 
precise and timely diagnoses.  This project aims to explore the capabilities of 
ML (Models like SVM, KNN, random forest) and CNN techniques in accurately 
identifying brain tumors from MRI images. By leveraging state-of-the-art 
algorithms and methodologies, we strive to contribute to the ongoing research 
in medical image analysis and improve patient outcomes. 
The main objective of the project is to design a system which can detect Brain 
tumors through image classification by training on the available datasets and 
provide high accuracy results by utilising all the knowledge and available 
technology of ML/DL.
